Reducing your heat-trapping emissions does not mean 
forgoing modern conveniences; it means making smart 
choices, using energy-efficient products, and understanding 
which areas of your life generate the most carbon emissions. (
    Ten Personal Solutions to Global Warming) A decade ago, 
    global warming was not much of a concern as it is now. 
    No matter how much we are informed about it , we as a 
    society seem to ignore the future disasters that global 
    warming will acquire. Global warming is a “global” dilemma 
    and everyone has an obligation to help reduce emissions. 
    This phenomenon has a powerful impact on our climate, our 
    health, and our environment. As climates rise, so will diseases 
    creating more deaths in this world. The heat will warm our waters 
    causing the ice caps to melt. Global Warming can also cause natural
     disasters such as hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, and many more. 
     “...these impacts will continue to intensify, grow ever more costly 
     and damaging, and increasingly affect the entire planet — including 
     you, your community, and your family” (Global Warming Impacts). 
     The world is already in danger lets do something now before it worsens. 
     There is sufficient amount of evidence that can prove that humans are 
     the main cause of global warming.
