Global warming is the process in which the Earth’s
 temperature starts increasing. This happens because 
 industry, fossil fuels, agricultural processes caused 
 by human, natural, and other gas emissions, this factors 
 increase greenhouse gases, greenhouse gases are made up
of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. 
The greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere and prevent 
the suns warming rays to leave the Earth. So the sun’s
warming rays stay inside the Earth increasing its
average temperature. Global warming isn’t the end 
of the world, it’s just a natural process in which 
the Earth cleans or rinse organisms. 
Now a days the Automobiles, heat from homes and businesses, 
and factories are responsible for about 80% of today's carbon dioxide
