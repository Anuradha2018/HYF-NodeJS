Lastly many bodies of water become polluted thanks
 to all the gasses in the atmosphere that mix with 
 the clouds and fall as acid rain polluting rivers, 
 and lakes and killing many animals. All of theses 
 factors change our daily life and can ruin whole 
 species, and all of this is because of temperature changes.

Many scientific methods of controlling or lowering 
the Earthâ€™s temperature are being researched; these
 can also be called geoengineering. Geoengineering 
 is a method in which scientists can change the levels 
 of greenhouse gases directly or indirectly. Also there 
 could be methods that prevent greenhouse gasses to be 
 emitted. There have never been any geoengineering 
 solutions done on a global scale since it has to be 
 almost proof less. But there have been some ideas that 
 are being use on a small scale like the iron fertilization;
 this is a process in which iron is injected into the oceans
 to speed up the reproduction of plankton which breath 
 carbon dioxide and emit oxygen, this is one solution that 
 seems to have the least side effects thanks to the reason
 I just presented and also due to that plankton are the base 
 of many marine animals food chain. So this method is being
 widely researched to see if it can be done on a global scale. 
 Not only is lowering the levels of gases in the air important,
 but also lowering the level of gases we emit, and there have 
 been many scientific breakthroughs like solar energy or cars that run
